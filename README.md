# Green-Sutra: AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System

#### Green_Sutra
###### A programming model intend to assist farmer as a faming tool
_Green-Sutra_ is a smart and accessible agricultural advisory platform designed specifically for small and marginal farmers in India. With a focus on increasing crop yield, resource efficiency, and financial resilience, Green-Sutra combines **Artificial Intelligence**, IoT sensors, and Natural Language Processing to offer context-aware recommendations that help farmers make better decisions throughout the cultivation cycle. 
From identifying the next best crop to planning resource allocation and protecting fields, the platform addresses the key pain points of modern farming in a data-driven yet user-friendly way.

Farmers can interact with the platform using regional languages through a voice-based interface, making technology approachable even in the remotest areas. Green-Sutra not only guides farmers on what to grow and how, but also connects them to government schemes, agricultural advisors, and marketplaces — minimizing dependence on middlemen and helping them access timely support and improved profits.

To improve accuracy, the system learns from feedback — recording outcomes like yield after each season and refining its recommendations based on real-world results. Additionally, IoT sensors in the field detect unexpected movements (like animal intrusion) and send instant alerts to the farmer’s phone, reducing the risk of crop damage.

At its core, Green-Sutra empowers farmers with answers to four essential questions:
- What to grow?
- How to manage resources?
- Where to invest for the best returns?
- And how to stay informed in real time?


## Features
- Personalized crop recommendations based on soil type, climate, and season.
- Smart irrigation and fertilizer suggestions to optimize resource usage.
- Disease prediction and early warning system using climate and crop data.
- Voice-based multilingual interface for ease of use in rural communities.
- Real-time alerts for animal intrusion and field threats using IoT sensors.
- Connectivity to advisors, government schemes, and trusted buyers.
- Seasonal feedback tracking to enhance prediction accuracy over time.
- Weather forecasting to aid short-term planning and disaster readiness.
- Crop rotation and land utilization strategies for long-term sustainability.


## Technologies Used
Green-Sutra is built using **Python** for the core logic and advisory engine. The **Google Gemini API** powers the **NLP** and conversational intelligence features, allowing seamless multilingual interaction. A curated dataset — enriched with data from **ICAR, KVKs,** and global agricultural organizations — serves as the backbone of AI-based predictions.

**Arduino-based** sensors are deployed in the field to detect physical threats like animal invasions and send alerts through a web interface built with **HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript**. The system also uses **TTS/STT APIs** to offer **speech-based input and feedback** for better accessibility.


## Real-World Applications
This application is ideal for farmers who need localized and timely advice without access to expert agronomists. Whether it’s predicting the next suitable crop based on soil and climate, managing **fertilizers and water stress efficiently**, or receiving disease warnings tied to environmental conditions — Green-Sutra delivers actionable insights directly to the farmer.

It reduces waste, increases productivity, and supports informed decision-making. Additionally, the platform connects farmers with trusted buyers and government welfare programs, unlocking better **market opportunities and financial aid.**


## Future Scope
Green-Sutra is designed for scalability. In the future, we plan to introduce mobile-based **disease detection using images**, integrate drone and satellite data for soil and yield analysis, and offer smarter credit recommendations. As adoption grows, the platform will evolve into a **full-scale ecosystem** — one that empowers Indian agriculture with sustainable, intelligent, and inclusive technology.
